# Assistant

This "assistant" is designed to run within Docker on our home Wi-Fi network, and talk to the various devices around the house. It is completely configured—hardcoded, even—with our needs in mind, and is not designed to be configurable. If you'd like to use any part of Assistant, please fork and edit.
